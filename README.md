Intial stages of app, intent on adding more user interaction and cleaning up layout. Had some intial problems with uploading images and naming them intially in files with Caps vs un caps on some. For exampling uploading "Kratos1" and a additional imagine and naming it "kratos2" those small details cost me some time just overlooking it and getting the id's mixed up from fatigue of looking at the code to long.
